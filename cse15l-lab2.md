# Lab Report 2

## Part 1

##### This screenshot shows the output if the url "localhost:4000/add-message?s=Hello" is executed. It uses the handleRequest method to properly format the new line by giving it a number, a period, the message itself, and then a "\n" to prepare for another message. Without any message, the message "Empty message list!" is given. In this case, the relevant arguments involve the handleRequest which takes in a url and separates it based on the path. In the case of just showing the messageList ArrayList, it takes in a "/" and creates a printed version of the messageList. The relevant fields change when messages are added and "add-message" is shown in the URL. The ArrayList is updated to show new information and contain messages that are passed into the URL.

##### This screenshot shows the output if the url "localhost:4000/add-message?s=How are you" is executed. As with the last message, it uses the handleRequest method to properly format the new line by giving it a number, a period, the message itself, and then a "\n" to prepare for another message. In this case, the relevant arguments are the parameters[0] and parameters[1] which find which part of the URL is the request and which part is the message itself. Again, the ArrayList is updated to show new information and contain messages that are passed into the URL.

##### This URL is converted to "localhost:4000/add-message?s=How%20are%20you" to handle the spaces

## Part 3
##### Something new that I learned in this lab was creating a new directory on a remote computer with the terminal, understanding the "url.getPath()" function, utilizing StringBuilder(), and that the GitHub error "Something went really wrong, and we canâ€™t process that file." means that the file name is incorrect/incompatible with GitHub. Although this lab was much harder than the last one, after completing it, I feel like I have learned some lessons that I will take further into this class and the future. I'm becoming more familiar with navigating filestructures in terminal and was able to quickly navigate back to the right local directory after accidentally "cd"-ing on my own computer.
